## About

Welcome to Moodify, an iOS application that recommends songs to its users depending on their mood and listening patterns gathered using the Spotify API.

Moodify uses a simple algorithm to generate playlists that match a user's mood from a pool of the user's "top songs". 
A user's "top songs" are gathered from their top artists data, top songs data, and Spotify-generated recommendations which are all filtered to create a single playlist that matches a user's "mood". A user's "mood" is calculated from user-provided "happiness" and "energy" values, and these, along with the user's listening patterns are used to find songs that match their preferences.
