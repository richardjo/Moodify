## About

Welcome to Moodify, an iOS application that recommends songs to its users depending on their mood and listening patterns gathered using the Spotify API. 

Moodify uses a simple algorithm to generate playlists that match a user's mood from a pool of their "top songs" gathered from their top artists data, top songs data, and Spotify-generated recommendations. These top songs are all filtered to create a single playlist that matches a user's "mood", calculated from user-provided "happiness" and "energy" values.
