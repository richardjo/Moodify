## About

Welcome to Moodify, an iOS application that recommends songs to its users depending on their mood and listening patterns gathered using the Spotify API.

Moodify uses a simple algorithm to generate a playlist that matches the user's mood from a pool of the user's "top songs". 

A user's "top songs" are also pooled from their top artists data, top song data, and Spotify-generated recommendations. These songs are then filtered and combined to create a single playlist that is then presented to the user. A user's "mood", which is used to filter the "top song" data, is calculated from the the user-provided "happiness" and "energy" values.
