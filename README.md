## About

Welcome to Moodify, an iOS application that recommends music to its users depending on their mood and listening patterns which is gathered using the Spotify API.

Moodify uses a simple algorithm to generate a playlist that matches the user's mood from a pool of the user's "top songs". 

A user's mood is calculated using two factors: "energy" and "happiness" which are specified by the user. 

A user's "top songs" are pooled from their top artists data, top song data, and Spotify-generated recommendations. These recommendations are "seeded"
