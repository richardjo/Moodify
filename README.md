# Moodify
## About

Welcome to Moodify, an iOS application that recommends songs to its users depending on their mood and listening patterns gathered using the Spotify API.

Moodify uses a simple algorithm to generate a playlist that matches the user's mood from a pool of the user's "top songs". 

A user's mood is calculated using two factors: "energy" and "happiness" which are both specified by the user. A user's "top songs" are also pooled from their top artists data, top song data, and Spotify-generated recommendations. These songs are combined to create a single playlist that is then presented to the user.
